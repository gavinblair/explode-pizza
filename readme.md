Fork this project and edit index.html to create your own event! Edit the location, date/time, the Eventbrite* link, and Twitter link.

When you're ready, just send the following link** to everyone you know: http://{yourusername}.github.com/explode-pizza

* don't forget to set up an Eventbrite event, or this won't work :P

** make sure you've pushed to the "gh-pages" branch of your repository
